# boggy-retina

## Description

This repository is a place to collaborate and build out simulations to describe unwanted spread of activation observed in the retina.

## Quick Start

The generate a plot of the spread of extracellular current in a normal retina under stimulation with one electrode, run the following from the [Simulations directory](./Simulations/):

```
AnyElecConfig_RotatedNeurite_4L_Depth
